Chapter 1:
First function - ROUND
- In C2, fill in a formula that rounds the value in B2 to the nearest integer. Don't forget to start the formula with a =. 
    You should use the ROUND function discussed before, and pass it the reference as an argument.			
- Copy the value of C2 down to C13. 
    You can do so by dragging your mouse from the lower right corner of C2 to C13. 
    The values in C2:C13 should all be filled in and contain the rounded values of B2:B13.				

Function composition - SQRT
- In C2:C13, fill in the SQRT of the values in B. You can start with C2 and copy the values downward.				
- In D2:D13, fill in the rounded values of C.				
- Note that you needed 2 columns to find the rounded square root. 
    In E2:E13, fill in the rounded square root of the values in B, by using function composition. 
    This way you only use 1 column. The values should be the same as in D2:D12.				

Functions and ranges - MIN, MAX
- In B15, calculate the minimum value in B2:B13. Use the MIN function, which can be used with ranges. 
    Don't forget to start your formula with =.				
- In B16, calculate the maximum value in B2:B13. Use the MAX function, which also accepts ranges as arguments.				

Selecting ranges - SUM, AVERAGE, MEDIAN
- In C2:C13, fill in the SQRT of the values in B. You can start with C2 and copy the values downward.				
- In D2:D13, fill in the rounded values of C.				
- Note that you needed 2 columns to find the rounded square root. 
    In E2:E13, fill in the rounded square root of the values in B, by using function composition. 
    This way you only use 1 column. The values should be the same as in D2:D12.				

Multiple arguments - RANK
- In C2, find out the rank of B2 in the following range: B2:B13.				
- Make B2:B13 an absolute reference in C2. You can do this by hand, or by selecting the range and hitting F4.
- Copy the value of C2 down to C13 to get the ranks of all sales. This will only work if you followed the second instruction correctly.				

Even more arguments - RANK
- In C2, fill in the rank of B2 in B2:B13, considered in an ascending order. 
    Don't forget to use an absolute reference as you did in the previous exercise!			
- Copy the value of C2 until C13.				
- "Fill in D2:D13, checking whether the rank in column C is smaller than or equal to 2, to find the worst 2 months. 
    You can use the comparison operator: ... <= ... (fill in the dots).
    Your output should contain TRUE or FALSE based on the comparison in each cell."		
    
String manipulation - LEFT, RIGHT
- You need to be able to identify each movie using a maximum of 4 characters, so you create a new column: movie id. 
    In E2:E11, try to take the last 4 characters of the movies in A. 
    Use RIGHT here. Does the result make a lot of sense?
- In F2:F11, try to take the first 4 characters of the movies in A. 
    Use LEFT here. This seems to make a bit more sense.

String information - LEN, SEARCH
- In E2:E11, find the number of characters in the directors' names using LEN.
- In F2:F11, find the position of the space in the directors' names using SEARCH.
- In G2:G11, find the number of characters in the directors' surnames by subtracting the values in F from the values in E.
- In H2:H11, retrieve the directors' surnames using RIGHT and the number of characters in G.

Combining strings - CONCATENATE
- In F2:F11, fill in the first character of the first name of the directors. For example, F2 should contain R. Use LEFT to achieve this.
- In G2:G11, the values should evaluate to the surname and the first character of the first name, with some punctuation. 
    For example G2 should evaluate to Johnson R.. Use CONCATENATE to achieve this.
